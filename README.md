# RailsFixGoogleBotAccept

This gem fixes the `ActionView::MissingTemplate` error generated by Rails when a page is requested with the header `Accept: */*;q=0.9` (or any other number).

The Google bot does such requests.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'rails_fix_google_bot_accept'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

That's it.
